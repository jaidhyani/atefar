  "rationale": "produce the task_setup_script. We need to create a bash script that sets up the environment for running the task evaluation functions. Here's how we'll approach this:\n\n1. Create the script structure with a help message and argument checking\n2. Set up variables for the output directory\n3. Create functions to generate each required file\n4. Set up a Python virtual environment\n5. Install required packages\n6. Add error handling and logging\n\nLet's implement this step by step:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Help message\nif [ \"$#\" -ne 1 ]; then\n    echo \"Usage: $0 <output_directory>\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Set variables\nOUTPUT_DIR=\"$1\"\n\n# Create output directory if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p \"$OUTPUT_DIR\"\n\n# Function to create files\ncreate_files() {\n    # Create instructions.txt\n    cat > \"$OUTPUT_DIR/instructions.txt\" << EOL\nTask 1: Implement Alternating Flip Augmentation\nImplement the alternating flip augmentation method as described in Section 3.6 of the paper. Your implementation should:\n1. Take a batch of images and the current epoch number as inputs.\n2. For the first epoch (epoch 0), randomly flip 50% of the images horizontally.\n3. For subsequent epochs:\n   - On even epochs (2, 4, 6, ...), flip only those images that were not flipped in the first epoch.\n   - On odd epochs (3, 5, 7, ...), flip only those images that were flipped in the first epoch.\n4. Use a deterministic method (e.g., hashing) to decide which images to flip, ensuring consistency across epochs.\n5. Return the augmented batch of images.\nYour implementation should be efficient and not significantly slow down the training process. Use PyTorch tensor operations for best performance.\n\nTask 2: Optimize Network Architecture\nImplement the optimized network architecture described in Section 3.1 and Appendix A of the paper. Your implementation should:\n1. Create a PyTorch nn.Module that represents the entire network.\n2. Implement the following key components:\n   a. A 2x2 convolution with no padding as the first layer.\n   b. Three blocks of convolutional layers with BatchNorm and GELU activations.\n   c. MaxPooling layers between blocks.\n   d. A final linear layer with appropriate scaling.\n3. Use the channel widths specified in the paper for each block.\n4. Implement the Conv, BatchNorm, and ConvGroup classes as described in Appendix A.\n5. Ensure the network is compatible with half-precision (float16) training.\n6. Initialize the network weights according to the paper's specifications, including identity initialization for convolutional layers.\n\nTask 3: Implement Patch Whitening Initialization\nImplement the patch whitening initialization for the first convolutional layer as described in Section 3.2 of the paper. Your implementation should:\n1. Take the first convolutional layer (nn.Conv2d) and a batch of training images as inputs.\n2. Extract 2x2 patches from the input images.\n3. Compute the covariance matrix of these patches.\n4. Perform eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix.\n5. Initialize the convolutional layer weights using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues:\n   a. Scale the eigenvectors by the inverse square root of their corresponding eigenvalues.\n   b. Set the first half of the filters to these scaled eigenvectors.\n   c. Set the second half to the negation of the first half.\n6. Add a small epsilon to the eigenvalues to prevent numerical issues.\n7.
