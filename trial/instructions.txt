Implement the alternating flip augmentation method as described in Section 3.6 of the paper. Your implementation should:
1. Take a batch of images and the current epoch number as input.
2. For the first epoch, randomly flip 50% of the images horizontally.
3. For subsequent epochs, deterministically flip images based on whether they were flipped in the first epoch:
   - On even epochs (2, 4, 6, ...), flip only those images that were not flipped in the first epoch.
   - On odd epochs (3, 5, 7, ...), flip only those images that were flipped in the first epoch.
4. Use a pseudorandom function based on image indices to determine which images to flip, avoiding the need for extra memory.
5. Ensure that your implementation is efficient and can handle large batch sizes.
6. Compare the performance of your implementation with the provided baseline random flip augmentation in terms of both accuracy improvement and computational efficiency.
Your function should be compatible with PyTorch\'s data augmentation pipeline and should be able to be easily integrated into the training loop.
